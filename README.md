# Calculator-Using-Python
Desgined a calculator as a mini-project using python

<b>Problem Statement:
Write a program to create a calculator which can perform arithmetic 
operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc, 
depending upon input from the user. Create lists, functions, conditions 
and loops to execute the program. </b>

We were divided into a group of 3 students and were told to design a project using Python.
We used object oriented programming. We defined a function for each arthic operation and called
it in the final while loop. Used try & except statements, to make sure the calculator is error free. 

We used try & except in all functions; In addition, subtraction, & multiplication to remove ValueError and
make sure that user only enters integer or float values. In division we used lambda operator along with try & excpet, 
to remove ZeroDivisionError to make sure user does not enter denominator as 0. For sqaure root operation, we used 
basic if else statement to avoid square root of negative numbers. Similarly in power dunction, we used nested if else 
statements to avoid negative numbers being raised to values within -1< raise_to <1. 

In the final while loop statement, we used nested if else statements to ask the user about the arithmetic operator 
they want to use. If user enetered any operator outside the given options, the program will give aan error and remind
the user to select an operator from the given choices only. 

<b>I have also provided a basic code for Calculator using C with the help of switch cases. However, focusing on the python project and trying our best to make the project more and more efficient and error-free. I wish to continue and keep working on the project and build a GUI based calculator around the same. I am also open to any suggestions, so please do! </b>
